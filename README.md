# CSS-Exercises
Hello Odin
In this assignment we will be using CSS on a project for the first time. I am looking forwarding to seeing how I do. I am also excited as I am getting a lot more comftable with GIT. I am will update postives and negatives as they arise for this assigment. 
First lesson was CSS Methods - Everything went very smooth and strait forward. Basically exactly like the lesson. 
Second lesson was a little more challenging. Not sure why, everything makes sense but feel like I has to think through each step more. 
Third lesson easy
Fourth Lesson was also pretty easy and self explanatory
Got a confused for a second on the final lesson, but not to big a deal. Everything makes sense. 
Today is a new day and we are working on cascades. First big win is I have accessed these files through git for the first time without having to go back to git basics lesson. We will start lesson and see how things go. 
Very confused in this lesson. I will need to review this lesson again and will probably check outside sources as well. 
I have decided to redo this lesson to make sure I understand it correctly. 
Ok had to do some outside reseach but I got it now.
