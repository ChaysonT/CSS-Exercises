# CSS-Exercises
Hello Odin
In this assignment we will be using CSS on a project for the first time. I am looking forwarding to seeing how I do. I am also excited as I am getting a lot more comftable with GIT. I am will update postives and negatives as they arise for this assigment. 
First lesson was CSS Methods - Everything went very smooth and strait forward. Basically exactly like the lesson. 
Second lesson was a little more challenging. Not sure why, everything makes sense but feel like I has to think through each step more. 
Third lesson easy
Fourth Lesson was also pretty easy and self explanatory
Got a confused for a second on the final lesson, but not to big a deal. Everything makes sense.
